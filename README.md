# Flixter
Flix is an app that allows users to browse movies from the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

by: **Ivan Gonzalez**

Some feautures:
- Details for each movie (ratings using RatingBar, popularity, and synopsis).
- Trailer videos in full-screen using the YouTubePlayerView.
- Views responsive for both landscape/portrait mode.
   - In portrait mode, the poster image, title, and movie overview is shown.
   - In landscape mode, the rotated alternate layout uses the backdrop image instead.

#### BONUS

- [ ] Trailers for popular movies are played automatically when the movie is selected (1 point).
  - [ ] When clicking on a popular movie (i.e. a movie voted for more than 5 stars) the video should be played immediately.
  - [ ] Less popular videos rely on the detailed page should show an image preview that can initiate playing a YouTube video.
- [ ] Add a play icon overlay to popular movies to indicate that the movie can be played (1 point).
- [ ] Apply the popular ButterKnife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate. (1 point)
- [ ] Add a rounded corners for the images using the Glide transformations. (1 point)
